        This bootcamp was taken up by Mr.Shaurya Sinha. The bootcamp lasted for
        7 days and was an amazing experience. It didnt require any prerequisite
        and hence the course could be taken up by anyone who was interested. The
        course covered topics related to Javascript, HTML and React.js.
